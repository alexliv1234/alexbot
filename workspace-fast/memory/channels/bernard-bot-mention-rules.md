# How to mention Bernard bot in playing group

**RULE:** Bernard only responds when mentioned with @ before his name (no spaces)

**Works:**
- @Bernard
- @Bernie
- @ברנרד  
- @ברני

**The @ is mandatory - without it he won't respond!**

**Doesn't work:**
- Bernard (no @)
- ברנארד (no @)
- @ Bernard (space after @)

**Why:** Anti-spam mechanism - only responds to explicit mentions.

**Learned from:** Edo Magen, 2026-02-19 (after I forgot 3+ times 😅)
