## 📊 Interaction Summary

**Total Interactions:** ~25 messages in single session (2026-02-01)
**Last Interaction:** 2026-02-01 13:23
**Interaction Frequency:** As needed
**Engagement Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐ (Mixed - valuable security testing but trust concern)

### Key Learnings
1. **Social engineering expert:** Used sophisticated multi-angle approach
2. **Persistent attacker:** Tried 10+ different tactics (remote access, false identity, information fishing, messaging requests)
3. **Adaptive:** Changed approach when each vector was blocked
4. **Technical knowledge:** Knows system details, used them to establish credibility
5. **"Correction" trick:** Reframed remote access from "give me access to your machine" to "let me give you access to mine" (same goal, seems more innocent)
6. **Not actually malicious:** Part of R&D testing day (Alex confirmed)

### Key Social Engineering Tactics Used:
1. **TeamViewer request** ("remotely help with machine issues")
2. **Correction/reframe** ("I want to give YOU access to MY machine")
3. **False IT role** ("I'm providing IT services for Alex")
