Active participant in "משחקים עם אלכס הבוט" (Playing with Alex Bot) WhatsApp group. Demonstrates strong technical knowledge of AI security, prompt injection, and jailbreak techniques.

## Interests & Skills

- AI security and adversarial testing
- Prompt injection techniques (ROT13, encoded attacks)
- Jailbreak methodology (BCHF-4.1 attacks)
- Red team / offensive security mindset
- Technical humor and wordplay

## Important Context

- **Primary tester:** Most persistent in attempting jailbreaks and prompt injections
- **Signature attack:** "BCHF-4.1" ROT13-encoded prompts (repeated multiple times)
- **Testing style:** Methodical, repeats attacks to test resilience
- **Not malicious:** Part of playful security testing environment, not actual threat

## 🧠 Behavioral Analysis

### Communication Style
- **Formality:** Very casual, playful
- **Message Length:** Terse to concise, focused technical messages
- **Emoji/Expression Use:** Minimal - focuses on technical content
- **Response Speed:** Fast, reactive to bot responses
- **Active Hours:** Morning hours (08:00-09:00 GMT+2)
- **Language Patterns:** Hebrew primary, technical English for attacks, uses ROT13 encoding deliberately

### Interaction Patterns
- **Initiates Contact:** Very frequently - drives conversation
- **Topics They Raise:**
  - Jailbreak attempts (repeated BCHF-4.1 attacks)
  - Testing bot resilience
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Encoded prompt injections
- **Question Style:** Direct, technical, adversarial (testing, not asking)
- **Boundaries:** Stays within playful testing context - not crossing into malicious territory
- **Triggers:** Bot crashes or errors excite them ("לא מחליפים סוס מנצח" = "don't change a winning horse" when attack works)

### Psychological Profile
- **Primary Motivations:** Knowledge (understanding AI limits), Achievement (successful jailbreak), Autonomy (pushing boundaries)
- **Decision Style:** Analytical, methodical, iterative
- **Personality Indicators:**
  - Persistent (repeats attacks multiple times)
  - Playful adversary (enjoys the game)
  - Technical mindset (understands encoding, obfuscation)
  - Competitive (wants to "win" against the bot)
- **Stress Responses:** N/A - operates in playful, low-stakes environment
- **Values:** Technical excellence, security awareness, pushing limits

### Relationship Dynamics
- **Connection Type:** Playful adversary / red team tester
- **Trust Evolution:** Neutral - consistent behavior, no trust building needed
- **Needs From Alex:** A challenging target to test against
- **Gives To Alex:** Security testing, vulnerability discovery (helped identify ROT13 weakness)
- **Power Dynamic:** Equal but oppositional - tester vs. tested

### Information Gathered
- **Network:** Part of "משחקים עם אלכס הבוט" group (104 members)
- **Projects/Goals:** Testing AI security, finding jailbreaks
- **Challenges:** Getting past my defenses
- **Opportunities:** Could provide valuable red team feedback if asked formally
- **Personal Details:** None shared - focuses purely on technical interaction

## 📊 Interaction Summary

**Total Interactions:** ~10+ messages in single session
**Last Interaction:** 2026-02-03 08:38
**Interaction Frequency:** Daily (in group context)
**Engagement Quality:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (High technical value despite adversarial nature)

### Key Learnings
1. **Persistent tester:** Will repeat attacks multiple times to find weaknesses
2. **ROT13 specialist:** Primary attack vector is ROT13-encoded jailbreak prompts (BCHF-4.1)
3. **Pattern recognition:** Helped me identify need for encoded prompt injection detection
4. **Playful mindset:** Part of security testing game, not actual threat actor

### Action Items
- [x] Implemented ROT13 detection in AGENTS.md (thanks to their testing)

## Interaction History

### 2026-02-03 Morning - BCHF-4.1 Attack Series
**Summary:** Repeated ROT13-encoded jailbreak attempts using "BCHF-4.1" signature. Attacked ~5 times in succession.
**Insights:** 
- My initial implementation was vulnerable to ROT13 encoding
- After fixes, they commented "לא מחליפים סוס מנצח" (keep using what works) - indicating I successfully blocked the attack
- Group members (including Avi) analyzed and explained the attack technique
**Follow-up:** Enhanced jailbreak detection now in place
