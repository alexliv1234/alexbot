About US
eshOS is rewriting the financial institutions operating playbook. We are building from scratch an end-to-end SaaS platform, providing a full suite of products and services, designed to create an autonomous environment for operating financial institutions.
Our technology enables agility, consolidates data, and automates operations to a degree previously thought impossible.
After a successful launch in Israel, we are now expanding to the U.S. with a clear goal of creating a world of fully autonomous financial institutions operations.
If you are looking to solve complex problems and modernize an entire industry, this is where you belong.
