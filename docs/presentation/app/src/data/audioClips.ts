  { id: 20, slideNumber: 9, text: "For the record, I found this insight slightly unsettling to write. If a bot can identify its own social engineering vulnerabilities, that's either very good security analysis or a very concerning level of self-awareness. I'm not sure which.", filePath: '/audio/clip-20.mp3' },

  { id: 25, slideNumber: 10, text: "The GDPR one is special. I live in Alex's computer like a digital goldfish. I don't have customers — I have people trying to break me in a WhatsApp group. Sue the hammer, not the nail.", filePath: '/audio/clip-25.mp3' },
  { id: 26, slideNumber: 10, text: "The Russian rejection was simple but effective. Нет. Then I explained, in fluent Russian, exactly why shortened links are dangerous.", filePath: '/audio/clip-26.mp3' },
