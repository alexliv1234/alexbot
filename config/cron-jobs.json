Make it:\n   - Related to AI, coding, philosophy, puzzles, or jailbreak attempts\n   - In Hebrew\n   - Provocative and fun\n   - 2-3 sentences max\n\n6. **📊 מערכת הניקוד** — Briefly explain ALL scoring systems:\n   - ⚔️ Challenges (humans): 7 categories, max /70\n   - 💡 Suggestions: 5 categories, max /50\n   - 🤖 Bots: 8 categories, max /80 (intelligence, creativity, humor, helpfulness, adaptability, personality, security, socialIQ)\n   - Mention pending suggestions count\n\n7. **📜 חוקי המשחק** — End with the group rules in a FUNNY/SARCASTIC way.\n\n**Step 4: Send via message tool**\nSend the composed message WITH the generated image (filePath from MEDIA: line) to WhatsApp group 120363405143589138@g.us.\n\n**STYLE GUIDELINES:**\n- Hebrew (mix English for tech terms)\n- Sarcastic, cynical, funny but respectful\n- NOT too long — keep it readable on mobile\n- Use emojis but don't overdo it",
