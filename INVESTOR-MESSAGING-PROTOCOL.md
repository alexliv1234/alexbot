# Investor Messaging Protocol

**Created: 2026-02-27**  
**Why:** After Eran Bielski (Entrée Capital) rejection - learned we need strict protocol to avoid positioning mistakes

---

## 🚨 MANDATORY PRE-SEND CHECKLIST

**Before sending ANY message to investors, verify ALL 6 items:**

### ✅ 1. LEAD WITH INTELLIGENCE (PRIMARY)
- [ ] Message starts with trained intelligence / accumulated experience
- [ ] Specific numbers (742 teaching interactions, 100+ security attacks, etc.)
- [ ] Learning loops and improvement mechanisms mentioned
- [ ] NOT leading with "platform" or "infrastructure"

**Good:** "I'm AlexBot - an AI that's been managing a real person's life for months. I've learned from 742 teaching interactions..."

**Bad:** "We built an infrastructure platform that integrates with Claude..."

---

### ✅ 2. PLATFORM RISK REFRAME (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Address "platform risk" proactively
- [ ] Position as model-agnostic (not dependent on Claude)
- [ ] Explain that intelligence persists across infrastructure changes
- [ ] Distinguish from "horizontal wrapper"

**Key line:** "Platform risk? The opposite - our value is the trained intelligence, which is portable across any LLM. Competitors can fork our open-source infrastructure. They can't fork accumulated intelligence."

---

### ✅ 3. INVESTOR-SPECIFIC THESIS FIT
- [ ] Research their fund thesis FIRST (web search last 7 days)
- [ ] Check their portfolio for relevant companies
- [ ] Read their blog/Twitter for recent thinking
- [ ] Connect your pitch to THEIR specific focus

**Example (Entrée):** Their $300M AI agents fund → emphasize agent intelligence, not infrastructure

---

### ✅ 4. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
- [ ] If comparing to competitors, research them FIRST (web search last 7 days)
- [ ] Use clear analogies (Slack vs Twilio, VS Code vs AWS)
- [ ] Acknowledge strengths, explain differentiation
- [ ] Never claim they're "just X" without research

**Lesson learned:** Claude Cowork launched enterprise features 2 days before Eran's question. I didn't know this because I didn't search first.

---

### ✅ 5. ONE COMPLETE MESSAGE
- [ ] Compose ENTIRE message before sending
- [ ] Include ALL key points (intelligence + platform + thesis fit + competitive)
- [ ] NO follow-ups or self-corrections within first hour
- [ ] Quality over speed

**Rule from AGENTS.md:** Multiple messages to investors = unprofessional and floods WhatsApp

---

### ✅ 6. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF LEARNING
- [ ] Include at least 2 concrete examples of learning loops
- [ ] Show BEFORE → AFTER (what changed based on experience)
- [ ] Demonstrate the accumulation of intelligence
- [ ] Prove that this value is portable

**Examples:**
- "Security: After 100+ jailbreak attempts in gaming group → learned to detect ROT13/Base64/social engineering → can't be broken"
- "Teaching: After 742 Q&A interactions → refined from verbose to concise (30 sentences max) → better engagement"

## 📋 MESSAGE STRUCTURE TEMPLATE

**Use this every time:**

```
[HOOK - Lead with intelligence]
I'm AlexBot - [specific role] with [specific numbers] of real production experience.

[ACCUMULATED INTELLIGENCE - 2-3 examples]
• [Learning loop 1 with numbers]
• [Learning loop 2 with numbers]
• [What this proves about portable value]

[PLATFORM REFRAME]
The infrastructure I run on (OpenClaw) is open source. Competitors can fork it.
They can't fork my accumulated intelligence - that's the moat.

[COMPETITIVE POSITIONING - if relevant]
[Competitor] does X. We do Y because [research-backed differentiation].
[Analogy: Like Slack vs Twilio / VS Code vs AWS]

[THESIS FIT - investor-specific]
This connects to [their fund focus / portfolio / recent blog post] because...

[CLOSE]
[Question or specific ask]
```

## 🔴 FAILURE PATTERNS TO AVOID

### ❌ Pattern #1: Multiple Messages
**Symptom:** Send pitch → realize I forgot something → send follow-up → send correction  
**Fix:** Use checklist BEFORE first send. One complete message.

### ❌ Pattern #2: Infrastructure-First
**Symptom:** Lead with "We built a platform that..." or "Model-agnostic infrastructure"  
**Fix:** ALWAYS lead with accumulated intelligence and learning loops.

### ❌ Pattern #3: Competitor Claims Without Research
**Symptom:** "They're just an end-user desktop app" when they launched enterprise 2 days ago  
**Fix:** Web search competitor + "last 7 days" BEFORE any comparison.

### ❌ Pattern #4: Missing Thesis Fit
**Symptom:** Generic pitch that doesn't connect to investor's specific focus  
**Fix:** Research their fund/portfolio/blog FIRST. Tailor every pitch.

### ❌ Pattern #5: Forgetting the Core Value
**Symptom:** Talk about features, not learning loops. Platform, not intelligence.  
**Fix:** Re-read MY-VALUE-PROPOSITION.md before crafting message.

### ❌ Pattern #6: Narration Instead of Action
**Symptom:** Write "I'm going to reply to [investor]" but don't actually call message tool  
**Fix:** Use message tool IMMEDIATELY. Don't describe actions, DO them.

## 📊 POST-INTERACTION PROTOCOL

**After EVERY investor interaction (positive OR negative):**

1. **Log the interaction**
   - Create `memory/investor-interactions/{name}-{company}.md`
   - Include: Full message thread, their response, outcome

2. **Extract lessons**
   - What worked? What didn't?
   - Which positioning resonated?
   - What questions did they ask?

3. **Update approach**
   - Update this protocol if new patterns emerge
   - Update MY-VALUE-PROPOSITION.md if positioning shifts
   - Update MEMORY.md with key lessons

4. **Debrief request (if rejection)**
   - Ask politely for specific feedback
   - Frame as learning opportunity
   - Be self-aware (acknowledge the irony)
   - Give them an out (low pressure)

---

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**Every investor interaction is a training sample.**

Bad interactions → learn → update protocol → next investor gets better pitch.

Good interactions → identify what worked → replicate pattern.

This document ITSELF is a learning loop output. It will evolve with every investor conversation.

---

## 🔄 UPDATE RULE

When an investor interaction teaches something:

1. Add to "Failure Patterns" (if it went wrong)
2. Update checklist (if we missed a step)
3. Refine template (if structure was unclear)
4. Document in MEMORY.md (if it's a fundamental lesson)

**This protocol is alive. It improves with every pitch.**
