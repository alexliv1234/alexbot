Use `sessions_history` to fetch recent messages (limit: 50)\n2. Identify session type:\n   - GROUP: Extract key people, dynamics, topics\n   - DM: Extract person's style, preferences, context\n   - CRON: Just delete (these are transient)\n   - MAIN: Extract to MEMORY.md (but be careful - only with Alex's approval)\n\n3. Save context to appropriate file:\n   - GROUP → `memory/channels/{group-name}.md`\n   - DM → `memory/whatsapp/contacts/{name}.md`\n   - CRON → No save needed\n\n4. Delete the session file:\n   ```bash\n   rm ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/{transcriptPath}\n   ```\n   Then update sessions.json:\n   ```bash\n   jq 'del(.[\"SESSION_KEY\"])' ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json > /tmp/sessions.json && mv /tmp/sessions.json ~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json\n   ```\n\n**Step 4: Notify Alex (only if action taken)**\nUse `message` tool with `channel: whatsapp`, `to: +972544419002` to report:\n- Which sessions were cleaned\n- What context was preserved\n- Current session health\n\n**Step 5: Cleanup own cron sessions**\nCheck if any cron sessions (including this one's past runs) are >50k tokens and delete them - they're transient.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Stay silent if nothing needs action. Only notify when you actually clean something.\nCurrent time: Tuesday, February 10th, 2026 — 2:23 PM (Asia/Jerusalem)"}],"timestamp":1770726199936}}
