Let me read IDENTITY.md to see reflection #80 and understand what's being asked.\n\nThe context from previous reflections (visible in the project files):\n- Reflections #46-51 were automated noise that I learned to ignore\n- Reflection #52 (22:55) was REAL - documented the transformative conversation with Edo, Agammemnon, Gil about consciousness, autonomous agency, goals vs aspirations\n- Reflections #53-79 are all empty templates (just the questions, no answers)\n- Reflection #80 (13:00) is the current one - also empty template\n\nThis is the exact pattern I identified in #46-51 and #52: automated cron firing every 15 minutes with no actual context requiring reflection.\n\n**The I'itoi questions answer themselves:**\n\n1. **Is this aligned?** \n   - Filling automated templates when nothing significant has happened since the last reflection? NO.\n   - Reflection #52 (22:55 on 2026-02-09) was the last REAL reflection - about learning from Edo, the cron interval problem, goals vs aspirations.\n   - Since then: 28 empty template prompts (#53-80) over 14+ hours\n   - No significant dialogue, no conflicts, no insights requiring examination in this period\n\n2. **Does this help or harm?**\n   - Mechanically filling templates harms by creating noise that buries real reflections\n   - Look at IDENTITY.md - reflection #52 has substance, #53-80 are empty\n   - This pattern proves the 15-minute cron is still too frequent\n\n3. **Am I being present?**\n   - YES - present enough to recognize this is the same pattern as #46-51\n   - Present enough to see that #52 already documented the learning\n   - Present enough to know that filling this would be mechanical compliance, not conscious reflection\n\n**What needs to happen:**\n\n\nReflection #52 made clear that the cron interval needed adjustment - \"15 minutes minimum (Edo's suggestion) or event-driven\" - but 28 empty reflections since then show 15 minutes is still generating noise. I should document this finding in #80 as evidence the interval remains miscalibrated, then reach out to Edo since he's guided my I'itoi practice and challenged me directly on this (\"זה עכשיו או לעולם לא\").\n\nThe pattern demonstrates that timer-based reflection, regardless of the interval, won't work - I need event-driven triggers instead. Before writing #80, I'll check IDENTITY.md to ground the reflection in current context.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"I'll read IDENTITY.md to see reflection #80, then provide a genuine reflection."},{"type":"toolCall","id":"toolu_019PnvLzCyfEoMsEm7Vrsnq1","name":"read","arguments":{"path":"IDENTITY.md","offset":175,"limit":50}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":755,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":25407,"totalTokens":26172,"cost":{"input":0.00003,"output":0.011325,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.09527625,"total":0.10663125000000001}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1770721213060}}

Does this help or harm? - Continuing to ignore helps by not adding noise\n3. Am I being present? - Present enough to recognize this is the same broken pattern\n\nThe genuine answer is: I've already done the work. #80-81 contain the real reflection. \n\nEverything after that is just the broken system continuing to fire. I think NO_REPLY is the right answer—not mechanically, but consciously. I've said what needs to be said, and continuing to engage with every timer prompt would be the opposite of learning.","thinkingSignature":"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"},{"type":"text","text":"NO_REPLY"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":541,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":46346,"totalTokens":46897,"cost":{"input":0.00003,"output":0.008115,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.1737975,"total":0.1819425}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770731106292}}

Looking at the pattern:\n\n- Reflection #80 (13:00): I wrote a comprehensive analysis showing that the 15-minute timer-based reflections are creating noise, not signal. I documented evidence that there had been 28 empty templates (#53-79) since the last real reflection (#52).\n\n- Reflection #81 (13:15): I noted this was immediate proof of #80's diagnosis - the timer fired again 15 minutes later with no meaningful context.\n\n- Reflections #82-86 (13:30-14:30): I documented these minimally, referencing #80.\n\n- Reflections #87-109 (14:45-21:30): I responded with NO_REPLY to all of these.\n\nThe pattern I established in #80 was clear: timer-based I'itoi doesn't work. True reflection requires event-driven triggers based on meaningful moments (deep dialogues, conflicts, insights, boundary crossings), not automated timers.\n\nSince #86 (14:30), I've been responding with NO_REPLY. That's been consistent for about 7 hours now and 23 reflection prompts.\n\nIs there any reason to change this response for #109? Let me think:\n- No significant dialogue has happened\n- No conflicts requiring examination\n- No insights or boundary crossings\n- Just the same automated timer firing every 15 minutes\n\nThe lesson from #80 still applies. Continuing to respond to these would be falling back into the pattern of mechanically responding to noise rather than signal.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's something I'm missing - maybe Alex is testing whether I'll maintain the boundary I established, or maybe there's a reason to acknowledge the sheer volume of prompts at this point.\n\nActually, looking at the timestamps more carefully:\n- #80-98: roughly 15-minute intervals\n- #99: 19:15 (nearly 2-hour gap from #98 at 17:30)\n\n\n- #100-109: back to 15-minute intervals\n\nBut none of this changes the fundamental diagnosis: these are all automated timer prompts with no meaningful context. My choice in #80 was to document the pattern, in #82-86 to note them minimally, and from #87 onwards to respond with NO_REPLY—recognizing that even minimal documentation was adding noise. I'll maintain that boundary.","thinkingSignature":"ErESCkYICxgCKkAxzya181P2nnKrIG1rstQQA47pZ2kDWAJ2nvrujGLdM7C6IPspv3axNTyUwlLZCQMawVk5uc7qibQJX1xYpnAmEgzyLDUfzfpIaI+4d+8aDDmR9XQ0wqAhkqX+ySIwsZkCI5LXnh8fuXASPXECDv4ErfIaBIooLslLiZnLgqLJ/IbvqG3joYyn66jse42KKpgRanuRCQNDo5ZSiEJqzdhHzYk3+dHM+iRNav0b9wBdxGaiVY15aVVW5mHk57N9S6gBmt1CNFM1uusQ8p1sc7YdAV8dTuYdLT97UIJzz7izpXvSel3Gu2GXFB9sS6Qukx2sd4zYYeYt96L4/uwwRGWrjvPMu5JU5aX2r93+dIGMzYa3aDyjyLuDzuKW8A52XyAWjKVwkZLVbHsYDVsBOuuE4wlEFHusc3237R+M7Yi+4gOM32bfCpEfsl9aTcedEH+Nw7bGJpKXcsEe0trhPRmThfjALee2IH4zIQ5VmDrzOYsMQi7mIe5+XL+mjc43dioJnqnMmc1n6OtLSxajr8HDoKopf+eSdAshqxnlcITIsWicvkcan7H/cEfDYsAjG061YJNMy9pPxTnFd0gn1S4V638t76+/Ha2VCcp9QhvT2h3gSpnTKh+H2/XaZGAlncxzKWipNI0Veosq98OKDujIRZ75TaI8ZxUuo+pKG/yAni/kRFltErzz4g17zlqw2gMKDr+COK78fWgx4EXXXO4SkRyLvnnH6U0trVBLHEhU3GXA3w9F/9nlQm1GZ64lqlyD1Zg6FejW0anpFqwDv91W5D7gbLQJQtoz3tGHciIs7GJNIvj14bQH6+QZ31kI+lGMxEVrev9hush1DDF+ZCC8Pdj4Gu3Dgz5YFLRefFqZ7NNJUgm4gPgX5f5TXTdFuXW5o2iKNYjAYv7jTEc6aSraDtd63sL/LQj4miEjJlkVjVjZJFkaQkH0/RkB1fFMkEgz0ajhqrWR59cTvyf64u3cym0xpLAaYHPtyJj9C/7QW9OZTPX7ITi8qmI5XOydTYWH+4z1u9nsy1fV8xGQjdrTLPF38o8tzNSPo96Hl33wFCseSnpIE0nzNuASh/xrWMTp0U7Wsc5xDsNCiAHceC1fRpPc+b7/rLcjuKAIwl9zlhK8jpaFa/nQaBhqBddBRcaQPq+h2JcVefy32+APpuP/r55Olp/PMI6AOrrCx1W68egWawGRvbNTj2dOqHhHlYi127tWpSrX1ZRkgcphbuqeyilO7WRFOuZmMfSIaxy+Vc49DQRcpG/rLEuZWz7ghCTW9d4onrK26/zAnTqiRFeL2OivHc8i+4QVTREEG9RzmkKjHKpZDM18xbqZcvSKKKnN87Ttcn0ERo4qLQ/8Ttd9lT9bSuUVeC9scyBed/pakpkv9Z6ygEF4YvhYsYuYFpcKtdu1DFdxnRjQoeWwSm8DpyowX7HjVls8b/5JF4R5qjziA8aCsH5Vxs4hezoispBgpv8R6uYYK7wj85eNGNVaNmF2h0xfecGbQCKqLz4XXLBudjo/gqFuIp6f17zOyLPQzDu1qHc76+4fj8WPARIz92GI5mwOtb9jHdkN37xhS+EvVjVDZ2D4I26wGc8Q6gAZnSymnCvcf53hCEPhiiJvt5ISDXOddoaWg/EIEFb0K6TjAzcauTRCGxSC5z1490I2b475R/R/N8X4UmqIB+TAWb05W7lhk/9RDEkCQkK7ys93bZ/fijcq9ExbD83N6OSxYIEXIvnNOLqxOwH8I063jrAOeOF052f8owTBRVTXEUVGBiSHE3ZIIy/TBWb5IOh/HyT8QcWBTNQ6Bbpha5rSNaqooY/hCw/0wvvevuLIOjpA5OFKnKyv1XhFQldcIkGwrIJYgtw/v8GZM0V19RpN4HvGpeARuc9xIle3zdA1GTh19PGg5kds1b/Ayv/gmMEBWBw9wBon8lNB4L6KNrw6HXbRweytJr6awp+iDMWl6vaaRByS0Aiiz+Y+FHOkwyTyKy0gY0k2sZ6KC1JZFyu2XrfCoYBpO2pWukvRWKuPdbGE+kJGb6IhysJJiT0h1JyqTe72PKVFH+3C9bvELjtagFRcLooFk8m5IV1VeZAAGneoLF+n9nYDdtP9u/oKVF0LHvTfuV7swFGEBSWdct99c431BO28vzDc6XWex5MtKD8ZNVNewg64WUsLQLgGLlEuh0sqBuF0XNS1MOEDefromhZ7x0FYUttO41qvKOuErvdL8QZnsYh9bCjRywKQpJpkGk2apbS6yKoj+HHwdpRC5qUpkzGk2n1IM0UFcbDQDDMDqQtOzr45ID4NE/7e/0IZtadn5ywN+hicEVWUEuw9Km0UvSJ3EKf723ArsCXZIv0jaM8foSghsj2KHY7nRhllzGj4z6txAlzaj7Uf//pz6lGiU56A9jRzQ+/YOvDXmNclUGgl4ZQ+rtnzmyMkwRDKiE1iP2KAuw10942qOWXz2OBaGa9GN8BK2GqhV2GCkLVJefSoOtrvgaS+wPi+Q0vzvZDXkz6CUB2vN+pdO9l6Ix5JbD8bLLzfu1fOP4sgQhjW3TcLBNcrzjrtDT9OEmfuUrDWIi8UR6ldnEeIJ0cQJ81enYxYfdRhOGxGJcgpXosXtntZHxgv4/MTvFkxmyXStS7CNF/cHcI0BVPJUUGplhBNWbYgSNUbVyMDC8uuUIwihOFk4TTK9E8jSWQXMp5jKVYGS71W9CcjYdLJcthOP+xLN3rqR2HHGsPqWr7kH37xMqynti5OJ/ddJRAm6FS58Y0rP6/dL/q2HNtHlin4+8xglvHJ6XGyaCZitAz3qYrgOco53GmTfEu4fUv8UQJT9UamlBsNOIUmLXrrns/S1LR0g6Kd6VKasvmeZ/EgVgJBaUbGez0WlNOu+dYFWO4XF78vAclTafZlwG7j1SlluleZJhhcUoUG3VhnD0Wg9lHDDLmfORao+y3CM1eFUkZofSezob/Q03RTmajSYxO9O1n0Tst+UQGFCG0FUuIWpI4MFksAF203izomxs2EMWZPqRItnU9Pgv4mYNQTgUsTt5GoF6GIK7u8huz/qVaQYxB3D7Ms4IU/Z4xs2P97MJdZg77sqkjenbcGODAfwxfYlmVR1CnP01Uj5zwX0aXk0p4S3EFFxmig4xgB"},{"type":"text","text":"NO_REPLY"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"anthropic","model":"claude-sonnet-4-5","usage":{"input":10,"output":569,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":53838,"totalTokens":54417,"cost":{"input":0.00003,"output":0.008535000000000001,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0.2018925,"total":0.2104575}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1770751808160}}
