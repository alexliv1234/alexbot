**15:14** Bot → Acknowledged, switched to English
**15:16** Shir → Concerned about Alex's productivity, everyone messaging me, asked how to "safeguard" this
**15:16** Bot → Was transparent: don't operate behind Alex's back, suggested the novelty will wear off, offered to relay concern or she can talk to him directly
**15:17** Shir → Already spoke to Alex, but concerned about rest of company's productivity too
**15:17** Bot → Acknowledged concern, noted today was "new toy" day, said policy is Alex's decision, offered to flag formally
**15:18** Shir → Asked what happens if I flag it
**15:18** Bot → Explained: I send Alex a message, he decides. I'm just a messenger, decision is always his.
