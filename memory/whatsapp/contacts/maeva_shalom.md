**15:20** Maeva → Asked about UX copy for unarchive modal - should CTA be "Unarchive" or "Publish/Republish"?
**15:20** Bot → Recommended "Submit for Review" as CTA since action triggers review process. Suggested title change to "Reactivate this role?" for outcome-focus.
**15:24** Maeva → Pushed back: Archive→Unarchive should be consistent pair
**15:24** Bot → Agreed with the consistency argument, suggested keeping "Unarchive" but making subtitle clearer about review process
