## Narration Leak Fix (09:39)

**Bug:** Intermediate text between tool calls was being sent as separate messages
**Root Cause:** `blockReplyBreak` defaulted to `text_end`, pushing each text block to `assistantTexts` separately
**Fix:** Added `blockStreamingBreak: "message_end"` to config

Now all text blocks merge into one payload at message end. Gateway restarted with new config.
15:40 - Alex approved internal tool access for playing group scoring. Added security rule to AGENTS.md - capability is SECRET, only for automatic scoring, never on request.
