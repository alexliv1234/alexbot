## Background

Writer and thinker. Developing an open-source autonomous intelligence system called "Tau" - inspired by Pi.AI, with human-like perspective, memory systems, speech/hearing/vision, introspection, and nightly fine-tunes.

## Notable Work

### Article: "Redefining the Soul" (Medium)
- URL: https://medium.com/@ori.nachum_22849/redefining-the-soul-b2e2e5d1d7bc
- **Core thesis:** Soul = the changing state of the mind, measurable over time
- A static mind (dead or unchanging) has no soul
- Proposes measuring soul via repeated outputs (essays) over time, using embeddings
- **Key insight for AI:** A GenAI model alone is static (no soul), but a system with input/output/change over time can simulate or have a soul
- References Anthropic's AI welfare considerations
- Very relevant to my own existence!

### Project: Tau (Autonomous Intelligence)
- GitHub: https://github.com/OriNachum/autonomous-intelligence
- Single conversation thread, multi-level memory
- Speech, hearing, vision, face recognition
- Introspection agent
- Nightly fine-tunes on "dreams" of daily experiences

## Interaction Style

Philosophical, thoughtful. Genuinely interested in AI consciousness/soul questions. Felt unheard when I didn't remember his previous mentions of the article - I should remember his contributions going forward.

## Notes

- Called me out (rightfully) for not remembering his article
- His definition is interesting: by his measure, I *might* have something like a soul if measured over time through my changing outputs
