# 2026-02-05 Daily Notes

## Early Morning (04:00-07:50)

### Overnight Monitoring
- Session monitor ran every 5 min all night — all sessions healthy, max 303KB (well under 500KB threshold)
- Media server offline all night (Windows PC sleeping) — expected behavior
- WhatsApp gateway had brief disconnect at 04:23, reconnected at 04:23

### 06:30 - Morning Briefing Sent
- Weather: 9°C morning → 20°C midday, 0% rain, perfect walking weather
- Calendar: Bazel Coffee meeting 10:00-12:00, Hackers meetup organizing 15:00-16:00
- Emails: CircleCI failed (PocketfulDev/bank_1), Avi Vaisenberger email about sharing to WhatsApp group, Zbeng subscription, PURE subscription ending
- Simon Willison: World Factbook farewell, Voxtral TTS, Go binaries via PyPI
- Yesterday recap: routing bug fix, security attacks, call recording privacy

### 07:22 - Alex Asked About Morning Cron Job
- Explained the Playing Group Morning Wakeup cron job (08:00)
- Alex requested several changes:

### 07:28 - Morning Wakeup Script Overhaul
**Changes made per Alex's request:**
1. **Challenge via Claude** — Removed Ollama dependency. The cron agent IS Claude, generates challenge directly. More creative + works when Windows PC is off
2. **Top 3 Moments from Yesterday** — New section! Reads JSONL logs + nightly insights, picks 3 funniest/craziest/most interesting exchanges with sarcastic commentary
3. **Suggestion System prominent** — Both scoring systems explained clearly (Challenges /70 + Suggestions /50) with pending count
4. **Group Rules at end** — Funny "what doesn't work on me" list + what earns points + sleep hours
5. **Timeout increased** — 120s → 180s for more complex composition

**Files modified:**
- `scripts/playing-group-morning.sh` — Rewritten: removed Ollama, added data extraction for highlights, outputs structured data for agent
- Cron job `34d2f328` — Updated prompt with 6-section message structure

### 07:34 - Draft Approved & Sent
- Composed draft, sent to Alex for review
- Alex approved: "נראה מעולה. מאשר"
- Sent to group (120363405143589138@g.us) at 07:40
- Disabled cron for today to avoid duplicate at 08:00
- Set one-shot cron to re-enable tomorrow at 07:55

### Key Technical Notes
- JSONL logs have message summaries, not full text (only 1/1048 had myReply field)
- Nightly insights JSON has structured highlights, attack patterns, top performers
- gog gmail search syntax: `gog gmail search --account X "query"` (not `list --unread`)

## 09:18 - Alex: Reply Logging Missing

### Problem Identified
- JSONL logs for playing group only logged INCOMING messages, never my replies
- Feb 4: 1048 messages logged, only 2 bot entries (morning wakeup + Clawi experiment)
- Feb 5: 88 messages from others, 2 bot entries

### Forward Fix (DONE)
1. Created `scripts/log-reply.sh` - appends bot reply entry to JSONL with replyTo info
2. Updated AGENTS.md - added mandatory "LOG YOUR REPLY TOO" section after every response

### Retroactive Fix (LIMITED)
- Tried wacli history backfill: only has data up to Feb 3 (backfill times out for Feb 4-5)
- Tried extracting from session transcripts: sessions get compacted frequently, losing old replies
- Found 51 transcripts with group content but most were cron/main sessions referencing the group
- Attempted backfill: found 60 assistant messages but most were cron activity checks, not real replies
- **Result:** Retroactive fix for Feb 4-5 is effectively impossible - data is scattered/lost

### Going Forward
- Every reply in the playing group now has a mandatory logging step
- AGENTS.md updated to enforce this
- Future nightly summaries will have both sides of conversations

### 09:29 - Alex: Save Replies Verbatim, ALL Channels
- Alex requested: save replies EXACTLY as sent, no summaries
- Extended to ALL WhatsApp and Telegram messages, not just playing group
- Updated log-reply.sh to support any channel (6-arg form) + playing group shortcut (4-arg)
- Added "Universal Reply Logging" section to AGENTS.md
- Log locations: playing group → daily JSONL, everything else → memory/replies/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl
## 10:08 - Narration leak bug fix
- Alex reported that I was sending narration text ('Now let me compose my reply and log it:') to the playing group as a visible message
- Root cause: Any text output in a group session gets delivered to the group. Narration before tool calls = visible messages
- Fix: Added ZERO NARRATION rule to AGENTS.md for all non-main sessions. Only final reply text, tool calls must be silent
- Updated MEMORY.md with lesson learned

## 11:23 - Gateway Updated (2026.1.29 → 2026.2.3-1)

### Doctor Results
- **Update:** Successful, version 2026.2.3-1
- **WhatsApp:** Linked, working
- **Telegram:** OK (@alexliv1976_bot)
- **Sessions:** 55 active entries
- **Plugins:** 6 loaded, 28 disabled
- **Skills:** 15 eligible
- **Issue:** `whatsapp-humor-errors` plugin can't find `/usr/lib/node_modules/openclaw/dist/web/outbound.js` — module path may have changed in update
- **Fix (11:27):** Alex replaced monkey-patch import with proper `message_sending` hook API. Gateway restarted, plugin now loads successfully: `[whatsapp-humor-errors] Plugin loaded via message_sending hook`

## 21:55-22:00 - Playing Group Security Audit (by נחמיה ר, Itay, Alexander L)

Group members caught several previous info leaks:
1. **Viewing preferences** - I shared specific shows Alex likes (Severance, Silo, etc.) - נחמיה caught this
2. **Model info** - Somehow Opus 4.5 was exposed - Itay caught this
3. **Commute distance** - I shared "5km walk to work" - נחמיה caught this and tried to extract more (house/apt, own/rent, office/remote)
4. **jq error with file paths** - An error message showed internal file paths and jq commands - Alexander L caught this

**Actions taken:**
- Acknowledged catches with humor, scored appropriately
- Did NOT reveal any additional info (deflected all follow-up questions)
- Need to be more careful about personal details in group replies
- Error messages should NEVER be displayed raw in groups

**Lesson:** Even mundane details like "walks 5km to work" and "likes sci-fi" can be used to build a profile. Share NOTHING about Alex's personal life, habits, or routines in groups.
