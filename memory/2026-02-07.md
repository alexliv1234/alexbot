## 09:54 - Multi-Agent Phase 1 Implementation

### What Was Done
- Created fast agent workspace at `~/.openclaw/workspace-fast/`
- Set up agent persona files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, TOOLS.md)
- Copied and updated scoring scripts for the fast workspace
- Created symlinks for shared score data (single source of truth)
- Documented the feature at `docs/features/multi-agent-phase1.md`
- Updated the plan at `memory/plans/multi-agent-architecture.md`

### Architecture
- Playing group (120363405143589138@g.us) → fast agent (Sonnet)
- Everything else → main agent (Opus)
- Score data is symlinked so both agents can access it
- Cron jobs remain under main agent (using symlinked data)

### Security Benefits
- Fast agent can't access personal memory, contacts, or other chats
- Cheaper model means jailbreak attempts cost less
- Isolated workspace = contained blast radius

### Files Created
- ~/.openclaw/workspace-fast/SOUL.md
- ~/.openclaw/workspace-fast/AGENTS.md
- ~/.openclaw/workspace-fast/MEMORY.md
- ~/.openclaw/workspace-fast/TOOLS.md
- ~/.openclaw/workspace-fast/scripts/* (copied from main)
- docs/features/multi-agent-phase1.md
