# 2026-02-02 Daily Notes

## Session Summary (Evening)

### Context Overflow Issue - RESOLVED
- Around 19:08-19:33, I hit ~186,000 tokens from accumulated Clawders group messages + jailbreak attempts
- Caused repeated "An unknown error occurred" responses
- **Fixed:** Added `contextTokens: 100000` to config to prevent future overflow
- Sent humorous explanation to Clawders group explaining it wasn't a hack

### Channel Memory System - NEW
Set up per-channel memory to persist context across sessions:
- `memory/channels/clawders.md` - Clawders group context (who's who, dynamics)
- `memory/channels/README.md` - How to use channel memory
- `memory/learnings.md` - General lessons from interactions
- Updated AGENTS.md with the new workflow
