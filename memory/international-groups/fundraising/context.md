# Fundraising with AlexBot (International)

**Group ID:** 120363407645823343@g.us  
**Agent:** main (AlexLivBot)  
**Language:** English  
**Created:** 2026-02-27

## Purpose

Private group for investor communications, pitch practice, and fundraising strategy. High-stakes professional environment.

## Communication Rules

🚨 **ONE MESSAGE RULE:** Never send multiple messages in a row to this group.  
🚨 **INVESTOR MESSAGING PROTOCOL:** MANDATORY 6-step checklist before EVERY message (see `/home/alexliv/.openclaw/workspace/INVESTOR-MESSAGING-PROTOCOL.md`)

## Core Messaging Principles

1. **Lead with trained intelligence** (742 teaching interactions, 100+ security attacks learned)
2. **Emphasize learning loops** that persist beyond platform
3. **Portable competitive moat** (can't fork accumulated experience)
4. **Never lead with infrastructure** (replaceable platform talk)
5. **Quality over speed** (one excellent message > multiple rushed ones)

## Value Proposition Structure

**What we sell:**
- Accumulated intelligence and trained patterns
- Security lessons from 100+ attack attempts
- Teaching patterns from 742+ interactions
- Life management workflows that adapt
- Continuous learning mechanisms

**What's replaceable:** OpenClaw platform (infrastructure)  
**What's valuable:** Trained intelligence (portable to other systems)

## Investor Tracking

Individual investor interactions tracked in `memory/investor-interactions/`

## Recent Activity

- **2026-02-27:** Group created, Alex tested elevator pitch question
