# Quick Check - Before Sending to Investor

**Read this EVERY TIME before sending investor message.**

## ✅ The 6-Second Checklist

1. **Core Value?** → Trained intelligence (not platform)
2. **Proof?** → Security/Teaching/Life mgmt (with numbers)
3. **Moat?** → Can't fork intelligence
4. **Their Thesis?** → Connected to investor's focus
5. **vs LLMs?** → Layer on top (not competing)
6. **Complete?** → 🤖 emoji, "Alex" signature

## 🚨 Red Flag

**If your message could describe ANY SaaS/platform → STOP.**

You're missing the core differentiation.

## The One-Liner to Remember

*"I'm not selling a platform. I'm selling accumulated intelligence that compounds over time."*

If this isn't in your message → revise.
