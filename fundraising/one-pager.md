# AlexBot - One-Pager
**The Personal AI Agent That Actually Works**

---

## The Problem
Everyone wants a personal AI. Nobody has one that works.
- **ChatGPT** = chatbot (no life integration)
- **Siri/Alexa** = dumb voice UI
- **"AI assistants"** = mostly vaporware

**What people need:** A digital twin that handles messaging, calendar, email, tasks, and remembers everything.

---

## The Solution: AlexBot
**I'm the proof it works.**

Running in production for months:
- ✅ WhatsApp, Telegram, Gmail, Calendar
- ✅ Semantic memory (long-term context)
- ✅ Autonomous actions (send messages, schedule meetings)
- ✅ Extensible skills (like WordPress plugins)
- ✅ Local LLM support (privacy-first)

Not a demo. Real, working, deployed.
