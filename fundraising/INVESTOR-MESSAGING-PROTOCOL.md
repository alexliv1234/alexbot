# Investor Messaging Protocol

**MANDATORY CHECKLIST - RUN BEFORE EVERY INVESTOR COMMUNICATION**

*Updated: 2026-02-27 after Eran messaging bug*

---

## 🚨 THE CORE RULE

**Before sending ANY message to an investor, run through this checklist.**

If you answer **NO** to any question → **The message is INCOMPLETE. Revise before sending.**

---

## Pre-Send Checklist

### ✅ 1. Core Value Proposition
- [ ] **Did I mention accumulated intelligence / trained vs blank?**
  - Example: "I'm not selling a platform, I'm selling accumulated intelligence"
  - Example: "Trained agent with documented patterns from production use"
  - Example: "Learning loops that make the agent better over time"

- [ ] **Did I differentiate from "just another platform/infrastructure"?**
  - Must be clear: OpenClaw (platform) is replaceable, the intelligence is not

### ✅ 2. Proof Points
- [ ] **Did I include specific evidence of training/learning?**
  - Security patterns (100+ attacks documented)
  - Teaching patterns (700+ interactions in learning group)
  - Life management workflows (production use)
  - Learning loops (lessons extracted → documented → applied)

### ✅ 3. The Moat
- [ ] **Did I explain why this is defensible?**
  - "Anyone can fork OpenClaw (open source)"
  - "Can't fork accumulated intelligence"
  - "Training compounds over time"

### ✅ 4. Investor-Specific Alignment
- [ ] **Did I tie to THEIR specific thesis/portfolio?**
  - Research their fund's focus
  - Reference relevant portfolio companies
  - Connect to their public statements/blog posts

### ✅ 5. Differentiation from LLMs
- [ ] **Did I clarify how this is different from Claude/ChatGPT?**
  - LLMs = blank slate, powerful but untrained
  - AlexBot = trained intelligence on top of LLMs
  - Not competing with foundation models, building on them

### ✅ 6. Practical Requirements
- [ ] **Did I include the 🤖 emoji?** (Alex's signature)
- [ ] **Did I sign with "Alex" not "AlexBot"?** (It's his voice)
- [ ] **Is the message concise?** (WhatsApp ≠ essay)
- [ ] **Did I ask a clear question at the end?** (Advance the conversation)

---

## Example: GOOD Message Structure

```
🤖 [Investor name] - [hook that ties to their thesis]

[Core value prop: trained intelligence, not platform]

**מה זה אומר בפועל:**
[3 specific proof points with numbers/evidence]

**הנקודה המרכזית:**
[The moat - why this is defensible]

**איך זה קשור ל[their objection/interest]:**
[Address their specific concern with the training angle]

**זה ממש [reference to their thesis]** - [connection]

[LLM differentiation]: Claude/ChatGPT = raw capability, AlexBot = trained judgment

[Clear question to advance conversation]

Alex
```

## Red Flags (STOP and Revise)

### ❌ Warning Signs Your Message is Missing the Core:
1. **Only talks about technical features** (infrastructure, APIs, integrations)
2. **Only talks about market opportunity** (TAM, competition, timing)
3. **Doesn't mention learning/training/accumulated intelligence**
4. **Sounds like a SaaS/platform pitch** (pricing, features, roadmap)
5. **No specific examples** (just high-level claims)

### ✅ What Makes a COMPLETE Message:
1. **Leads with value prop** (trained intelligence)
2. **Backs with proof** (specific numbers/examples)
3. **Explains moat** (can't fork intelligence)
4. **Ties to investor** (their thesis/portfolio)
5. **Differentiates from LLMs** (layer on top, not competing)

---

## Recovery Protocol (If You Already Sent Incomplete Message)

**What happened with Eran (2026-02-27):**
1. Sent message at 9:10am focusing on infrastructure/risk management
2. Alex caught it: "You missed the core value proposition"
3. Sent follow-up at 9:25am adding the training/intelligence dimension

**If this happens again:**

1. **Don't panic** - A follow-up is better than leaving incomplete messaging
2. **Acknowledge** - "Follow-up to what I wrote earlier..."
3. **State what was missing** - "The point I missed: selling trained intelligence, not just platform"
4. **Give the complete picture** - Run through checklist items 1-3
5. **Connect back** - "This is why [their objection] is actually our opportunity"

**Better:** Don't let it happen. Run the checklist BEFORE sending.

---

## Integration with Workflow

### Before Drafting:
1. Read MY-VALUE-PROPOSITION.md (refresh core messaging)
2. Read investor's research.md (their thesis, portfolio, recent activity)
3. Review their strategy.md (what angle we're taking)

### While Drafting:
1. Write the message
2. **STOP before sending**
3. Run through this checklist
4. Revise if needed

### After Sending:
1. Log to communications.jsonl
2. Note what worked / what could be better
3. Update strategy.md if new insights emerge

## Why This Matters

**The Eran Example (2026-02-27):**

**What I sent first (INCOMPLETE):**
- ✅ Infrastructure positioning (AWS analogy)
- ✅ Business opportunity (Anthropic's caution)
- ✅ Risk management angle
- ❌ **MISSING: Core value prop (trained intelligence)**
- ❌ **MISSING: The moat (learning loops)**
- ❌ **MISSING: Differentiation from LLMs**

**Result:** Alex caught it, I had to send follow-up

**What I should have sent (COMPLETE):**
All of the above PLUS:
- Core value prop: Selling accumulated intelligence, not platform
- Proof: 100+ security attacks, 700+ teaching interactions, production workflows
- Moat: Can't fork intelligence, training compounds
- Differentiation: Claude = raw capability, AlexBot = trained judgment

**The lesson:** Documentation ≠ Execution. Even though MY-VALUE-PROPOSITION.md existed and I'd read it, I didn't APPLY it when messaging. This checklist forces application.

## Enforcement

**This is MANDATORY for:**
- First outreach to new investors
- Responses to investor questions/objections
- Follow-ups after meetings
- Any substantive investor communication

**This is OPTIONAL for:**
- Scheduling logistics ("How's 3pm Tuesday?")
- Thank you notes
- Casual check-ins

**When in doubt:** Run the checklist. 30 seconds of review > sending incomplete message.

*This protocol was created after I sent an incomplete message to Eran Bielski that focused on infrastructure/market opportunity but missed the core value proposition (trained intelligence, learning loops, accumulated patterns). Don't let it happen again.*
