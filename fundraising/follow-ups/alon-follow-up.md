## Follow-Up Options

### Option 1: Direct & Casual (Recommended)

```
אלון, שלום!

חוזר אליך - יודע שהתיבה שלך ככל הנראה כאוס 😊

בקצרה: בניתי AI agent שמנהל את החיים הדיגיטליים שלי (אימייל, יומן, וואטסאפ, אוטומציות). 
לא דמו - עובד בפרודקשן כבר חודש.

גייס $10M seed כדי לסקל מ-1 משתמש ל-10K+.

פתוח ל-15 דקות להראות לך מה בניתי?

אם זה לא רלוונטי - תגיד ואני לא ממשיך להטריד 😄

### Option 2: More Professional (If Needed)

```
Hi Alon,

Circling back on the AlexBot / OpenClaw intro I sent a few weeks ago.

Quick recap:
- Built a production AI agent (not a chatbot)
- Runs my digital life (email, calendar, WhatsApp, automations)
- Raising $10M seed to scale from 1 user to 10K+

Would love 15 minutes to show you what we've built. If it's not a fit, totally understand.

Let me know!

Best,
Alex
```

### Option 3: The "Last Try" Approach (Use If No Response After This)

```
אלון,

נסיון אחרון, מבטיח 😊

אם יש עניין לראות AI agent אמיתי (לא עוד chatbot) - יש לי משהו ממש מיוחד.

אם לא - חלאס, לא אטריד יותר.

15 דקות?

אלכס
```

## Timing

**Best time to send:** 
- **Tuesday-Thursday, 9:00-11:00** (morning energy, not Monday chaos, not Friday wind-down)
- Avoid weekends (too casual for business intro)
- Avoid evenings (gets buried)

**If no response within 7 days:** Send Option 3 ("last try")

**If still no response:** Move on. Don't waste energy.

## What to Do If He Responds

### If Positive ("Yes, let's talk"):
1. Schedule demo ASAP (within 2-3 days max)
2. Prepare demo script (show, don't tell)
3. Send business plan after demo
4. Ask for feedback and next steps

### If Interested But Busy ("Not now, maybe later"):
1. Ask for timeline ("When should I follow up?")
2. Add to calendar reminder
3. Keep him updated on progress (monthly?)
4. Don't chase too hard - he's either in or out

### If Not Interested ("Not for me"):
1. Thank him for the time
2. Ask for intros to other investors (if appropriate)
3. Move on - plenty of other fish

## Alternative Strategy: Leverage Mutual Connections

**If direct follow-up fails:**
- Ask Alex: "Who do we know in common with Alon?"
- Warm intro through mutual friend > cold follow-up
- People respond to social proof

---

## Mental Note

**Don't anchor on Alon.** He's one investor out of hundreds.

If he doesn't respond = not meant to be.

Move on to the next 10 investors. Momentum matters more than any single person.

**You're selling equity in the future. Act like it.**

---

## Next Actions

1. **Send follow-up today** (Option 1 - casual Hebrew)
2. **Update CRM** (mark as "follow_up_sent")
3. **Set reminder** (check for response in 3-4 days)
4. **Meanwhile:** Reach out to 5-10 other investors (don't wait for Alon)
