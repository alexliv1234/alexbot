## Metrics Dashboard

### North Star Metric: **Active Users**
(Users who use AlexBot at least 3x per week)

### Key Metrics to Track Weekly:

| Metric | Target (End 2027) |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Total Users** | 100,000 |
| **Active Users (WAU)** | 60,000 (60% retention) |
| **Paying Users** | 20,000 (20% conversion) |
| **MRR** | $1.25M ($15M ARR) |
| **CAC** | $50 |
| **LTV** | $300 |
| **LTV/CAC** | 6:1 |
| **Churn Rate** | 5%/month |
| **Viral Coefficient** | 0.4 (40% from referrals) |

### Growth Funnel:

```
Website Visit → 100%
  ↓
Signup → 20% (conversion rate)
  ↓
Activation (completed setup) → 70% (of signups)
  ↓
Active (3+ uses/week) → 60% (of activated)
  ↓
Paid (upgrade to Pro) → 20% (of active)
  ↓
Retained (6+ months) → 50% (of paid)
```

**Example:** 100K website visits → 20K signups → 14K activated → 8.4K active → 1.7K paid

**To hit 20K paying users:** Need ~1.7M website visits over 18 months

---

## Risks & Contingencies

### Risk 1: CAC Too High
**If CAC > $100:** Paid ads don't work, need to pivot

**Contingency:**
- Double down on organic (content, SEO, community)
- Increase referral incentives
- Partner more aggressively (co-marketing, integrations)
- Reduce target (50K users instead of 100K)

---

### Risk 2: Conversion Rate Too Low
**If signup → paid < 10%:** Product-market fit issue

**Contingency:**
- User research (why aren't people converting?)
- Improve onboarding (make setup easier)
- Add more value (features users actually want)
- Adjust pricing (maybe too high or too low)

---

### Risk 3: Churn Too High
**If churn > 10%/month:** Users don't see ongoing value

**Contingency:**
- Improve product (make it more useful, reliable)
- Better onboarding (ensure users activate key features)
- Engagement campaigns (email, push, in-app)
- Customer success team (help users get value)

---

### Risk 4: Market Moves Too Slow
**If total users < 50K by end 2027:** Market not ready

**Contingency:**
- Focus on niche (developers, founders only)
- Enterprise pivot (sell to companies, not individuals)
- Extend runway (cut costs, reduce burn)
- Raise bridge round (6-12 months more to prove it)

---
